## Get started

```
ignite chain serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

### Configure

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more, see the [Ignite CLI docs](https://docs.ignite.com).

### Web Frontend

```
cd vue
npm install
npm run serve
```

```
ignite scaffold message sendReport target link description tags
ignite scaffold query report --response target,link,description,tags
```
